Most tests are designed to be run both under node.js and in browsers. The tests
are written using Mocha, but are not designed to be run in the Mocha framework.
Instead, they use the Mocha API, and are run simply using node <file>.js e.g.
node Tree.js.

Some tests have associated .html files. These are designed to be loaded into
browsers, where they will run the tests.

The libs subdirectory contains a downloaded version of jquery-ui. This is required because the version in node_modules is brain dead.
